# Group projects for Stochastic processes

Teammates:

- [Danyu Zhang](https://github.com/danyuz)
- Javier Esteban Aragoneses
- Mauricio Marcos Fajgenbaun

While the documents have been uploaded up on my github, I will link my classmate's github profiles as they create them.

It's been a pleasure working with you all and I look forward to doing so in the future.
