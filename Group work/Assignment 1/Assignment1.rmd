# Problem 1

## a)

Markov chain criteria:

1- The probability of being in a state only depends on the previous state.

2- It's a stochastic process.

$X$ = The chain hits state $j$ at time $n$

$X_{n}$ is the scenario at time $n$

All states have finite expected return times and are communicated with each other, also the MC is irreducible, therefore its stationary distribution is **unique**.

## b)

# Problem 2

## a)

Because our MC is an irreducible infinite state MC, we have a unique stationary distribution $\pi$, $\pi_{i} = \frac{1}{\mu_{i}}$ and all states have expected finite return times then we have:

$E[T_{i}|X_{0} = i] = \mu_{i} = \frac{1}{\pi_{i}}$
